                <li>Bastard
                    <p>Jin Sung can't find solace anywhere. At school he is bullied mercilessly due to his introverted nature and poor health. However, this is not the source of Gene's overwhelming terror: what he fears most is his own father.
                        For most, Gene's father is a compassionate man, a successful businessman and a loving parent. But this is only an appearance. The truth is that he is a crazed serial killer, and Gene is his unwitting accomplice. For many years, Gene had to help his father by misleading the police. However, when his father begins to show interest in exchange student Kyung Yoon, Jin must make a decision - be a coward who will send her to the gallows like everyone else, or become a bastard who defies his father.

                        Kurozu is a small Japanese town. According to Shuichi Saito, a friend of the main character Kirie Goshima, this city is cursed with spirals. They are visible everywhere - both in plants or hurricanes and in people. Shuichi's father is overcome by an obsession, and gradually every resident of the city is plunged into a whirlpool of events from which it is impossible to return...

                I'm currently reading a manga called "Good Night Punpun". Heavy manga, but very interesting.
                Here's a short description: Punpun is an ordinary -year-old schoolboy from Japan. An honest idealist and incorrigible romantic, the main character watches his life quickly change when a new girl, Aiko Tanaka, comes to his class. The boy learns how fragile relationships can be and how difficult it can be to give up the illusions of naive childhood. When one day Punpun witnesses his father hurting his mother, he learns a new lesson: those whom he once considered an example for himself turned out to be not at all what he thought. This is mangaka Inio Asano's deep story of growing up and adapting, full of conflicting emotions and intractable problems.

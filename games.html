                <h2>Sally Face</h2>
                <p>The best game I've ever played. Great music that I still enjoy listening to. Interesting characters with an equally interesting past. The plot is captivating from the first minutes. Oh, if only I could erase my memory and again feel those goosebumps that I had when I first played through the game.</p>

                <h2>Undertale</h2>
                <p>This is the first game I completed on my own, from start to finish. It has multiple endings and some of them made me cry. The game makes you think about the player's personality, as at some points the game breaks the fourth wall and begins to communicate with the player, putting pressure on his conscience. The game is full of different characters with whom you can interact.</p>

                <h2>Doki Doki Literature Club!</h2>
                <p>A game about a boy who gets into a literary club, all the girls take turns falling in love with him and going crazy. I played this at night and some of the scenes were very creepy. This is a visual novel. The game goes through quickly, which makes it even sad.</p>

                <h2>Yuppie Psycho</h2>
                <p>a game about a guy who was invited to work in a large company, but the company turned out to be full of mysteries and oddities. The goal of the main character will be to kill the witch; on his way he faces a lot of obstacles. There are also several endings, and I like them all. An addictive game that can be played in one breath. It has hints of horror. You have no idea how ecstatic I was when I completed the game.</p>
